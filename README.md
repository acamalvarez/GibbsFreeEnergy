# GibbsFreeEnergy

This little project calculate the Gibbs free enerby of reactions involve in the NH3-SCR of NO. I work with this kind of reactios, so in this way was easier to calculate Gibbs free energy of reactions. This methodology can be expanded to similar reactions involving the Hess's Law.

It uses pandas to read a CSV value with the properties of the compounds and you have to enter the reactions in a Python dictionary.
